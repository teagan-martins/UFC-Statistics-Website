# UFC-Statistics-Website
A website I designed which displays MMA stats for all UFC fighters (and MMA fighters). It utilizes Java Springboot, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The stats are gathered using web-scraping libraries in Python. Web pages are loaded dynamically. Not fully completed yet. There are plans to add many different features such as a better functioning search bar, forgot password option, delete account option, a load more scrolling feature, etc.
